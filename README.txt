This is related to the comp259 project where we are trying to merge a motion graph
and motion field into the exsisting SKA framework.


Currently To test our bvh files we are using the SKA app0002 project.
To change which .bvh file to load into ska you must modify the character_BVH() found in
the AnimationControl.cpp file in the different SKA app000 projects
